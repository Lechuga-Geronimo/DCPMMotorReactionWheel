# Characterization of a Direct Current Permanent Magnet (DCPM) Motor for the Modeling, Design and Control of a Non-Cots Reaction Wheel.
To determine the physical parameters of a DC motor in order to correctly obtain the model and stablish an adequate control for a self-made reaction wheel. 

## Year: 2016.

## Description.

The parameters were: 

* Armature resistance.
* Inductance**. 
* Back EMF constant. 
* Torque.
* Moment inertia.

** To determine the inductance, the method used was based on the time constant by charging and discharging the motor inductors.

## Diagram.
